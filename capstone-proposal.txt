Capstone Project Proposal - Social Safe (working title)


Concept
  Problem - In the time of Covid people want - and need - to go out and socialize with friends, family and loved ones. However, they often carry an uneasiness about whether their favorite restaurants, cafes, and bars are safely following social distancing practices. Further, in seasonal climates when the weather is cold, one doesn't know whether there are heat lamps or other features which would make outdoor socializing possible or enjoyable.

  Purpose - The Social Safe app would provide a resource for users to review restaurants, cafes and bars for general information such as location, ratings, photos, menus, etc., as well as providing crowd sourced information about social distancing and presence of heat lamps.

  Target Market - General Purpose


Features
  - Full CRUD - ability to create, read, update, and delete restaurants the user adds

  - Register, login and password functionality
  - An index page with cards of all restaurants and ability to search
